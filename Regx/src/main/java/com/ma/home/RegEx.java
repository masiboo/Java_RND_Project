 *
 * CHARACTER CLASSES
 *
 * [abc]	Matches a or b, or c.
 *
 * [^abc]	Negation, matches everything except a, b, or c.
 *
 * [a-c]	Range, matches a or b, or c.
 *
 * [a-c[f-h]]	Union, matches a, b, c, f, g, h.
 *
 * [a-c&&[b-c]]	Intersection, matches b or c.
 *
 * [a-c&&[^b-c]] Subtraction, matches a.
 *
 *
 * PREDEFINED CHARACTER CLASSES
 *
 *  .	Any character.
 *
 * \d	A digit: [0-9]
 *
 * \D	A non-digit: [^0-9]
 *
 * \s	A whitespace character: [ \t\n\x0B\f\r]
 *
 * \S	A non-whitespace character: [^\s]
 *
 * \w	A word character: [a-zA-Z_0-9]
 *
 * \W	A non-word character: [^\w]
 *
 * BOUNDARY MATCHES
 *
 *     â€¢ The beginning of a line.
 * $	The end of a line.
 *
 * \b	A word boundary.
 *
 * \B	A non-word boundary.
 *
 * \A	The beginning of the input.
 *
 * \G	The end of the previous match.
 *
 * \Z	The end of the input but for the final terminator, if any.
 *
 * \z	The end of the input.
 *
 * PATTERN FLAGS
 *
 * Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE Enables case-insensitive matching. Pattern.COMMENTS
 *
 * Whitespace and comments starting with # are ignored until the end of a line.
 * Pattern.MULTILINE
 *
 * One expression can match multiple lines.
 * Pattern.UNIX_LINES
 *
 * Only the '\n' line terminator is recognized in the behavior of ., ^, and $.
 *
 *
 * USEFUL JAVA CLASSES & METHODS
 *
 * PATTERN
 * A pattern is a compiler representation of a regular expression.
 *
 * Pattern compile(String regex)
 *
 * Compiles the given regular expression into a pattern.
 *
 * Pattern compile(String regex, int flags) Compiles the given regular expression into a pattern with the given flags.
 *
 * boolean matches(String regex)
 *
 * Tells whether or not this string matches the given regular expression.
 *
 * String[] split(CharSequence input) Splits the given input sequence around matches of this pattern.
 *
 * String quote(String s)
 *
 * Returns a literal pattern String for the specified String.
 *
 * Predicate<String> asPredicate()
 *
 * Creates a predicate which can be used to match a string.
 *
 * MATCHER
 * An engine that performs match operations on a character sequence by interpreting a pattern.
 *
 * boolean matches()
 *
 * Attempts to match the entire region against the pattern.
 *
 * boolean find()
 *
 * Attempts to find the next subsequence of the input sequence that matches the pattern.
 *
 * int start()
 *
 * Returns the start index of the previous match.
 *
 * int end()
 *
 * Returns the offset after the last character matched.
 *
 *
 * Greedy: Matches the longest matching group.
 * Reluctant: Matches the shortest group.
 * Possessive : Longest match or bust (no backoff).
 *
 * QUANTIFIERS
 *  Greedy | Reluctant | Possessive |  Description
 *  ________________________________________________________________
 *   X?    | X??       | X?+        | X, once or not at all.
 *  ________________________________________________________________
 *  X*     | X*?       | X*+        | X, zero or more times.
 *  _______________________________________________________________________
 *  X+     | X+?       | X++        | X, one or more times.
 *  _______________________________________________________________________
 *  X{n}   | X{n}?     | X{n}+      | X, exactly n times.
 *  _______________________________________________________________________
 *  X{n,}  | X{n,}?    | X{n,}+     | X, at least n times.
 *  _______________________________________________________________________
 *  X{n,m} | X{n,m}?   | X{n,m}+    |X, at least n but not more than m times.
 *
 *
 *  GROUPS & BACKREFERENCES
 *
 * A group is a captured subsequence of characters which may be used later in the expression with a backreference.
 *
 * (...)	Defines a group.
 * \N	Refers to a matched group.
 * (\d\d)	A group of two digits.
 * (\d\d)/\1	Two digits repeated twice.
 * \1	Refers to the matched group.
 *
 * LOGICAL OPERATIONS
 *
 * XY	X then Y.
 *
 * X|Y	X or Y.
